# Mastodon Hide Interacted Posts (Toggleable)

This userscript hides all Mastodon posts that you've **already liked or boosted**, to help reduce visual clutter in your timeline.\
The behavior is **toggleable via a floating button** in the UI, and the setting is remembered across sessions.
If the feature is switched to ON, the posts are hidden after 4,5s.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script observes all `.status` elements and checks whether:

- The post was **liked** (button with `.star-icon.active`)
- The post was **boosted** (button with `title` or `aria-label` like *"Beitrag nicht mehr teilen"* or *"Unboost"*)

If either is true, the surrounding `<article>` element is marked and eventually hidden.\
It uses `MutationObserver` to work with infinite scrolling.

## üë°Ô∏è Toggle Behavior

A small button appears in the bottom-right corner:

| State       | Appearance                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ON (active) | Blue button: `Interacted-Hiding: ON`  |
| OFF         | Gray button: `Interacted-Hiding: OFF` |

Click the button to toggle the hiding logic.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Delay Before Hiding

To help with debugging and testing, there's a short delay (default: 4.5 seconds) before a post gets hidden.\
This gives you time to verify that the detection worked.

```ts
const HIDE_DELAY_MS = 4500;
```
